            I 😀 can't fucking take it. I 😀 see 🙈 an image of a random 🎲
            object posted and then I 😊 see 👁️ it, I 😀 fucking see 👁️👀 it. "Oh
            that looks 👁️ kinda like 💚 the 🤘 among us guy" 👨 it started as.
            That's funny, 😄 that's a cool 😎 reference. But 😥 I 😀 kept going,
            I'd see 🙈🙈🙈 a fridge that looked like 💜 among us, I'd see 👀 an
            animated bag 💰 of chips 🍟 that looked like 👬 among us, I'd see
            👀🙈 a hat 🎓 that looked like ❤️🏩 among us. And every time 🕥 I'd
            burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh 😆 staring 🌠 at the 🤘
            image as the 🤣 words 🔜 AMOGUS ran through my 😊 head. 🤯 It's
            torment, psychological torture, I 😀 am being conditioned to laugh
            🤣 maniacly any time 🕔 I 😀 see 👀 an oval on a red 🆎🏮 object. I
            😀 can't fucking live like 💖 this... I 😊 can't I 😊 can't I 😀
            can't I 😊 can't I 😀😀😀 can't! And don't get 🉐 me fucking started
            on the 🤣 words! 🔜 I'll never hear 👂 the 🤘🤘🤘 word 🆚 suspicious
            again without 🍵 thinking 🗯️ of among us. Someone does something bad
            ⛔ and I 😊 can't say 🗣️ anything other than "sus." I 😀 could watch
            👀 a man 👨‍🦼 murder everyone I 😀 love 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 and all I 😀 would be able
            to say 🗣️ is "red 🔺 sus" and laugh 😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣 like 💞 a fucking
            insane person. 🚵 And the 🤘 word 🔝 "among" is ruined. The 🤣
            phrase "among us" is ruined. I 😀 can't live anymore. Among us has
            destroyed my 😊 fucking life. 🧬 I 😊 want to eject ⏏️ myself from
            😤 this plane 👨‍✈️ of existence. MAKE IT STOP! ⛔
